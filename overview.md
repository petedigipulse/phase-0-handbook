# Welcome to Enspiral Dev Academy's Phase 0!


## Expectations
Phase-0 is an integral part of the Dev Academy program. You will be expected to put in at least 15-30 hours of work per week (depending on experience) and at times you will find it overwhelming challenging - especially working remotely. We try to help you find the balance between taking responsibility for your own education, tracking your own progress, understanding and expressing your needs, and being supported and held accountable by us. You’re learning this balance in Phase 0, and it might get confusing or frustrating at times but that’s all part of the process.  Learning it here, during Phase 0, is what will help you maintain that balance during your 9 weeks at EDA.

You can track your own progress by checking in to see if you’re fulfilling expectations, completing challenges on time, and if you’re able to demonstrate the learning competencies. 

You will be expected to attempt and hand in all challenges. Those who do not meet the expectations or don't communicate with us about circumstances preventing the completion, are asked to repeat the units in the following cohort. 
Likewise, we may also ask those who are struggling with the material to repeat certain units before entering into a bootcamp. 

While this is a predominately remote learning phase, we have a community of coaches, support staff and alumni who will be available to help you during this time. Its important to use the tools we recommend, and to ask for help when you get stuck. In most cases we are able to virtually pair with you for coaching. There are also a limited number of on-site coaching options available for those who need it.

## Phase 0 structure 
Phase 0 is divided into 3 Units and each week you will be receiving a set of challenges and tasks to complete. The broad topics we cover in Phase 0 are:

Unit 1: Git, HTML/CSS, Ruby or C#  
Unit 2: Algorithms, Data and Object Oriented programming  
Unit 3: JavaScript, SQL Databases and Review Time

Each Monday we’ll send out the curriculum for the week. 

## Tools of the trade
##### Github
We use Github to host and distribute curriculum. Once you’ve signed up to Github ([see prerequisites](phase-0-prerequisites.md)), we'll grant you access to the "phase-0-unit-1" repo, where the unit-1 challenges.  
  
##### Slack 
Slack is a communication channel where you can chat to your peers and ask for help from the EDA community of teachers, coaches and alumni. When you accept the invitation to slack, you'll automatically be added to the core EDA channels:

1. **A cohort specific channel** : For cohort communication.. say for example finding a partner to pair with.
2. **A range of Q&A channels** : (e.g. Ruby-questions, C# questions).. where you can ask for help on a specific thing. 
3. **A general channel** : Stuff everyone in the EDA community should know about. For example, events, announcements, congratulating people.. that sort of stuff.
4. **A random channel** - for random stuff like Web development jokes.
5. **An ideas-and-feedback channel** : For cool things and improvements.  

For a little more info on our slack-usage, check out our [Slack intro guide](slack-intro-guide)

##### Google-group 
This is essentially like a mailing list for your cohort and is used to grant permissions to the student drive - home to digital copies of many of the books you will want to read.

##### Your @devacademy.ac.nz email address 
We will set everyone up with a .ac.nz email address. Note however, this is not like a normal email address - Any email sent to your devacademy.ac.nz address will be automatically forwarded to your personal email address. While you can't send email from it, you can use it to sign up to student discounts.

## Guided Pairing Sessions (GPS)
There will be 5-6 GPS sessions during phase-0 and you are expected to attend all of them. Please see [Guided Pairing Sessions](guided-pairing-sessions.md) for more help and details.   
  
## Peer Pairing Sessions
You are expected to pair with a peer a number of times each unit. See [Peer-Pairing Sessions](peer-pairing-sessions.md) for more information. 

## Submissions  
You will be asked to submit your challenges at the end of each week. They are due each Sunday at 11:59pm.

### Challenges  
Completing challenges does not mean that you have the right answer, the perfect code, or the best explanation.  It is your **own, honest, best** attempt at tackling the challenge using the process we defined (pseudocode, code, refactor, reflect), and we are most concerned with how quickly you can learn, not the "right" answer.

If you are starting as a bashful beginner, your attempts may not even yield a working solution.  This is OK.  The most important thing we need to see is your engagement, your dedication to learning the material.  If your solution ends up being 30 lines of pseudocode and you don't know where to begin, make a comment saying where you are stuck and submit it.  Then reach out to your cohort mates to see if anyone has solved the challenge and pair with them.

***
The objectives and challenges for each unit are not suggestions, and they are not optional.  These are expectations that we have of you in order for you to succeed and thrive during Phase 0, which will determine whether or not you’ll thrive during phases 1-3 at EDA.

We expect you to satisfy your objectives on time, which means completing the week’s assignments and challenges by the following Sunday at 11:59pm.  If for any reason you cannot submit all of the challenges by that day, you need to contact your Phase 0 Facilitator. [See Contacts](contact-and-support-list.md)

If you are not meeting these objectives and we do not know why, we start assuming one of two things:

1. You are having trouble with the content and are unable to learn quickly enough to satisfy the objectives.
2. You are not committed to Phase 0 and something has changed regarding your commitments to EDA and your learning.

In either of these cases if we cannot clear with you what’s going on and give you the assistance you need, this indicates to us that you might not be a good fit for EDA.

So if the situation persists and you are not satisfying your objectives, not asking for help, and we don’t know your situation, we will review your admittance to EDA and potentially ask you to withdraw or delay your admittance.

We hope this doesn’t sound too harsh or cold, but part of the reason for a more robust and engaged Phase 0 is to identify any problems you might have with EDA and learning our curriculum early, to spare you the pain, cost, and frustration of realizing any of these issues in Phase 1 after you’ve quit your jobs, uprooted, and changed your life.
