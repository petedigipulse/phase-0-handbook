# Frequently Asked Questions
This will be updated as you ask questions on the google+ community. 

**Q: Are Introductory Sessions on Skype or Google?**<br>
**A:** From this point, all of our sessions will be conducted via google hangout. If you signed up properly, you should have an event on your google calendar with a link to join the video call. Join the call at the appropriate times. Follow [these instructions](intro-gps-signup.md) to sign up. 

**Q: How do I change my EDA email address?** <br>
**A:** Unfortunately this isn't very simple at this point since we use multiple systems. You should contact the [facilitator](contact-and-support-list.md) with the following information to change your address: 

  Please include (just copy paste and fill in):
  
  1. Name:
  2. Cohort:
  3. Old email address:
  4. New email address:
  5. Do you want your email changed in Socrates as well? 

**Q: Can we use EDA space in Phase 0?** <br>
**A:** Unfortuntately at this time students are not able to use space on site during Phase 0, but we do have visiting hours. Please email your [facilitator](contact-and-support-list.md) to ask.

**Q: I didn't receive a google calendar invite. How can I get access to the necessary calendars?**<br>
**A:** Because we use google groups to maintain permissions (far easier than inviting everyone separately), you won't always receive an email. But if your address is correct in the google group, you automatically have access. Go to the google+ community and find the two calendar links under "About this community." You can then add them.
