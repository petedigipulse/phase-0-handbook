# Slack communication channel 

[The Enspiral-Dev-Academy slack channel](https://enspiral-dev-academy.slack.com/messages/general/) is where most of our communications will take place. 
When you join slack you will be automatically joined to our core channels:

1. **A cohort specific channel** : For cohort communication.. say for example finding a partner to pair with.
2. **A range of Q&A channels** : (e.g. Ruby-questions, C# questions).. where you can ask for help on a specific thing. 
3. **A general channel** : Stuff everyone in the EDA community should know about. For example, events, announcements, congratulating people.. that sort of stuff.
4. **A random channel** : for random stuff like Web development jokes.
5. **An ideas-and-feedback channel** : For cool things and improvements.  

## Using slack 
- We recommend that anytime you are working on the material you have slack open in the browser or in the desktop app. 
- You will need to opt out of channels that don't apply to you (e.g. if your a Rubyist, you wan't to opt out of CS-questions).
One way to leave a channel is to go to the channel, click on the channels name in the top left and select "Leave Channel". Another way is to start exploring the '/' options. Type '/' into the command line and see all the different options you have to interact with a channel.
- To see who is in the channel, click the grey person icon in the top right corner. 
- If you have a specific question for someone you can direct message them - but keep in mind that others in the community might know the answer too, so don't cut yourself off from the pool of community knowledge by posting unnecessary private messages.
- You can tag someone in your post by putting an @ in front of their user name. If they are not online, they will be notified via email. 
- If you want the whole group to know something, you can use @channel. This will send an email to everyone in the channel. 
- Post files, code, images. 
- Star items you want to reference later.
