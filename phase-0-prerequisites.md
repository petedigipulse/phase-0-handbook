# Welcome to Enspiral Dev Academy!
*Last Revised 30/01/2014*

You are in your pre-Phase 0 prep period. Before you can start Phase 0, you will need to complete a few administrative tasks and personal preparation. Please go through each of these sections and complete each task. You should be well acquainted with our program by the end and will be ready to start Phase 0 by your start date.

**Please note:** During the week prior to phase-0 you will begin to receive a number of important invitations to our Dev Academy systems. Please be on the lookout for these messages.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or feedback for the Phase 0 team, please contact us at <phase0@devacademy.co.nz>. Please mention your start date in the email.

# Before Entering Phase 0

#### Brief Introduction
Read Dev Boot Camp's [Blog Post](http://devbootcamp.com/2014/05/08/why-phase-0-is-key-to-your-success-at-dev-bootcamp/) on Phase 0. Phase 0 is an actual Phase of DBC; it is not optional. We cover the fundamentals you will need to be successful in the intensive portion of DBC.

You may be thinking that Phase 0 will not be intense because it is remote, but it is. Please refrain from scheduling any vacations, trips, etc. during Phase 0 unless you expect to do the work during that time and have reliable internet access. There are weekly deadlines for challenges, pairing requirements, and other tasks you will be required to do each week.

The amount of time it takes to complete each week varies greatly from person to person. On average people spend 20-30 hours a week, however some are able to complete in much less while others need to spend longer on the material. If you are unable to complete the material, you might be requested to repeat the phase. 

#### Choose your stream 
You will need to know which stream you are wanting to be in (Ruby or C# .NET) before phase-0 begins. Here is some advice regarding your equipment and setup, but please note 

- **we are unable to provide support for anything that deviates from industry standard (Ruby on Mac OSX or Linux, and C# .NET on windows.)**   
  
Ruby Students  
  
Ruby belongs to the open-source world and is generally geared towards a Unix development environment, such as Linux and Mac OS.
If you’re currently a Windows user, we highly recommend you consider installing a Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu, which can be installed in a separate partition of your hard-drive (allowing you to select between Windows and Ubuntu at startup) or in a Virtual Machine application such as VirtualBox which will allow you to run a Ubuntu environment directly from Windows.
Using a virtual machine is fine for Phase 0 but you will definitely want to consider setting your Linux up as a separate partition OS for the bootcamp phases and your future development career.  
   
   
C# .NET Students  
  
You will be focusing on the .NET framework, which is a Microsoft owned product and is therefore aimed at being used within a Microsoft Windows environment.
If you’re working on a Mac, you can setup a separate partition with Bootcamp which will then allow you to boot natively into a Windows environment on your Mac.



# Phase 0 Prerequisites

#### 1. Create Accounts
You will need each of these accounts for Phase 0. The general rule of thumb is to use your first name as part of your username wherever possible and include a photo of yourself (i.e. not your cat or bike). This helps us, the Dev Academy community of staff, teachers, coaches and alumni to better support and help you. 

- [Google](https://accounts.google.com/Signup)<br> It is necessary to either link your personal email address to google or to use a gmail account. If you applied to Dev Academy / have been corrosponding with us with an email address that you will not use as your primary google linked email, then please email <phase0@devacademy.co.nz> and update us with your details as soon as possible.

- [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/)<br> You will get a Socrates account when you start Phase 0, and it will pull your picture from Gravatar. Please make sure your picture is of your face so we can get as much practice with your name as possible. 

- [Github](https://github.com/)<br> You will start using github on day-1, so please create an account with **your first name as part of your github user name.** This will be where you keep all of your code from EDA and becomes your technical resume when you apply for jobs.
 
#### 2. Onboarding 
These links won't work immediately as you will need to be invited to join them - you will receive these invites during the week before phase-0 begins. Please make sure they are complete by the Friday before the start date and be sure to check your social messaging and spam folders. 

- [Socrates](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/)<br> You will receive an individual invite to socrates - The DevBoot Camp app that Dev Academy uses for activities like giving feedback. 

- [Slack](https://ensprial-dev-academy.slack.com/messages/)<br> Our Slack channel is where you communications and support requests take place. Quite often coaches and alumni will be on the channel and able to unstick you if you get stuck. We recommend using either the desktop app or have the web app signed on when you are working through the Phase 0 material.  

- [Google Groups and student Google drive](https://drive.google.com/a/enspiral.com/folderview?id=0B5aB0OHeInzgeWZoQm9VaWJQeWc&usp=sharing)
This is essentially a mailing list for your cohort (e.g. Kakapo-2015@devacademy.co.nz) and will give you access to learning materials that are stored on the student drive. 

#### 3. Orientation 
We will host a virtual orientation class the evening before phase-0 begins and on the evening of day one. Please schedule it into your calendars and be available to participate in EITHER one of the sessions (i.e. not both). Orientation will take about 45 minutes and will be a short intro to Dev Academy tools and challenge submission.

#### 4. Watch
The following videos introduce some key concepts of the Phase 0 experience.
You will be expected to be familiar with each of these prior to starting Phase 0.

- Engineering Empathy: [EQ: Emotional Intelligence](https://vimeo.com/99779530) 15 min
- Giving and Receiving [Feedback](https://vimeo.com/99780302) 27 min
- Checking in before [Pairing](https://vimeo.com/76662569) 5 min

#### 5. Update your browser
It's very important that you're using the latest version of your web browser. For Phase 0, we recommend working with [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/).</br>  
  
#### 6. Typing and shortcuts
It's important to be able to type at a decent clip in this new career you've embarked on! That said, it's not the end of the world if you struggle with typing, just take some time to practice, practice, practice!

- Take a baseline [test](http://www.typingtest.com/index.html) to see how fast you currently type.
- To learn the basics in touch typing and to improve your speeds, try either [typingstudy](http://www.typingstudy.com/lesson/1/part/1) or [typingclub](http://www.typingclub.com/typing-qwerty-en.html).
- If you are already an accomplished touch typist, try [typing.io](https://typing.io/) to practice typing code, which has a ton of strange symbols.
- For shortcuts, try [shortcutfoo](shortcutfoo.com). You'll want to know about some of the awesome sublime text shortcuts.
You need to be able to:
 - Type at least 40 words per minute
 - Use common shortcuts in Sublime

#### 7. Personal Preparation 

You are about to embark on a new learning experience. You will be challenged in new ways that will excite and frustrate you (often at the same time). It's important to prepare yourself for success by recognizing how you learn best and what you enjoy when you are in a learning environment. Recognizing what you need will help you be able to express what you need when learning and make your experience at Dev Academy more fulfilling. You will be spending a significant amount of time working with others, so it's important to practice explaining your ideas to others. **keep track of your results**

- Understand the difference between <a href="http://examinedexistence.com/carol-dweck-on-fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset/" target="_blank">growth and fixed mindset</a>.
- Identify your
<a href="http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=questionnaire" target="_blank">VARK learning style</a>.
- Understand your <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" target="_blank">thinking style</a> and what you enjoy or find challenging when learning (**optional**)

#### 8. Read the [Phase 0 Handbook](readme.md)
This detailed document outlines the Phase 0 Program in great depth, so please take time to read it and get comfortable with Phase 0 and Dev Academy!

#### 9. Complete the End of Prep Survey
last but certainly not least! Complete the [End of Prep Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-MW9w5sHtyWZCoFFyDoIqFU8xgDClGIQug2ufACy0-4/viewform) This is required to start Phase 0.
