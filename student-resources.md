# Student Drive and Student Resources 

The student drive is where we store digital copies of both recommended and required readings. 
To access any of the content below, we will have to add you to the google specific group and/or set you up with a .ac.nz email address. 

## The Student Drive 
[Student Drive.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5aB0OHeInzgeWZoQm9VaWJQeWc&authuser=0)  
Once you have been granted access, choose to "add it to your drive" and bookmark it for easy access.  

## Rubyists 
if you want a head start, start reading 
- Chris Pines [Learn to Program](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5aB0OHeInzgOWE3dF9tMzByVVk&authuser=0) and
- David Blacks [The Well grounded Rubyist](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5aB0OHeInzgXzFFd1ZhT2lUTjA&authuser=0)
As the course progresses, you'll most certainly want to read whats fondly referred to POODR 
- [Practical Orientated Design in Ruby](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5aB0OHeInzgcHFvZUVtNlZzQ3c&authuser=0)

## Sharpies 
If you'd like to get a head start, you are able to join up to Microsoft and have access to pluralsight.  
To enable you access to these premium products, each student has a firstname-lastname@devacademy.ac.nz email address which will forward automatically to the email address you used when you enrolled at Dev Academy. 
The process is a little long winded, but worth it. Once you're signed up to Pluralsight you get access to premium tutorials in C#.
